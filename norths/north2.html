                            parks. Situated below Mount Meru on the eastern edge of the eastern branch of the Great Rift Valley, it has a mild
                            climate</p>

                            <p>The road transfer from the Kilimanjaro International Airport to your lodge will take about 1 hour, so sit back and enjoy
                            the ride through the city's sub-urban arriving at your lodge for a well deserved overnight.</p>

                            wonder. Measuring 1,600 square miles and named for the life-giving Tarangire River that flows through its core, this is
                            Tanzania's fifth largest park. Most famous for its massive elephant herds and giant baobab trees, this park hosts an
                            annual "mini-migration" of sorts and offers the perfect setting for photography. During the dry season, huge masses of
                            animals stream into the park for its perennial water supply.

                                Tour a traditional Maasai Boma and learn about the proud and fascinating Maasai culture. A village chief will provide a
                                tour of the Boma and explain their beliefs and way of life. You may watch or take part in a traditional dance. Pictures
                                are welcome inside the Boma. There are several Maasai Bomas that our guides have relationships with. The location
                                provides for convenient access but is still far enough off the beaten path to avoid the main tourist circuit. A Maasai
                                village tour can be incorporated into any itinerary. This tour you will be told about tribal customs and the methods in
                                which they build their dwellings. The village we visit still preserves the traditional Maasai way of life and you will
                                be enthralled by the truly wonderful and inspiring tales that these people will tell you about their history and way of
                                life. You will also get a chance to learn how the Maasai women make their beautifully coloured and intricate jewellery.
                                The money raised from the sale of their traditional jewellery goes directly back into the local community. In addition,
                                when you join our Maasai Mara safaris you will be able to watch a traditional welcome dance – something truly special
                                that is sure to become a lifelong memory.

                            Lake Manyara is a scenic gem, with a setting extolled by Ernest Hemingway as “the loveliest I had seen in Africa</p>

                            <p>From the entrance gate, the road winds through an expanse of lush jungle-like groundwater forest where hundred-strong
                            baboon troops lounge nonchalantly along the roadside, blue monkeys scamper nimbly between the ancient mahogany trees,
                            dainty bushbuck tread warily through the shadows, and outsized forest hornbills honk cacophonously in the high canopy.
                            Manyara provides the perfect introduction to Tanzania’s birdlife. More than 400 species have been recorded, and even a
                            first-time visitor to Africa might reasonably expect to observe 100 of these in one day. Highlights include thousands of
                            pink-hued flamingos on their perpetual migration, as well as other large waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants and
                            storks.</p>

                                    famous. The best vantage points and worthwhile areas are chosen to give you the best possible chance to observe
                                    animals
                                    and to capture your perfect photo. Depending upon the time of year, you have the chance to see the great migration
                                    with
                                    a hundred thousand wildebeests and zebras. During the small rainy season in October and November, you will typically
                                    see
                                    these herds moving from the Kenyan Masai Mara through the northwest Serengeti to the plains in the south. After the
                                    long
                                    rainy season in April through June, the herds travel slowly back through the west and northwest Serengeti. With
                                    fluctuations in rainfall, this timetable can change the animals’ migration times and routes. Your guide will know
                                    where
                                    and when to find the animals and makes sure that you can see the animals from the best spots in the national park.

                        <p>Spend a full day exploring the vast Serengeti plains. Serengeti National Park quite simply offers the finest game
                            viewing in all of Africa. Unrivaled concentrations of wildlife, stunningly beautiful landscapes and vast pristine
                            areas
                            make this region our number one pick.</p>
                        <p>You will rise early to enjoy an early morning game drive. At sunrise you may encounter animals grazing in the
                            beautiful
                            light of sunrise and predators may still be busy hunting before retiring to rest for the day. Sunrise on the
                            Serengeti
                            is not to be missed and extraordinary photographic opportunities will abound at this magical time of day. You have
                            the
                            option to return to your accommodation for a hot lunch or to opt for a packed lunch which can be enjoyed at one of
                            the
                            various picnic sites found in the Serengeti. After lunch you will continue on a game drive. Around the time of dusk
                            be
                            on the lookout for lion. Cheetah can also be spotted on the plains in the early morning and late afternoon when
                            temperatures are not too high. They rely on daylight and speed to catch their prey. Hippo pods can be seen in the
                            bigger
                            pools and rivers while crocodiles can be seen sunning themselves on the riverbanks. You will return to Camp in time
                            to
                            enjoy a sundowner before your evening meal.</p>

                                migration) and September through November (during the southward migration.) Famous Mara River is the place where

                                many documentaries that are shot to document great migration crossing the river. Crossing the river is also probably
