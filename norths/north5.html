                            <p>Early morning you will be picked up from your hotel and drive to Tarangire National Park for a full day of game viewing
                            and photographing. Named after the river that flows through the park, Tarangire National Park is one of the lesser known
                            Tanzanian National Parks, giving it a real air of undiscovered Africa.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Famous for its tree climbing pythons, massive baobabs and large herds of elephant, Tarangire National Park is small but
                            still home to a significant wildlife population, with a density of wildlife matched only by Ngorongoro. Birding is
                            particularly good here; the swamps, tinged green year round, are the focus for 550 bird varieties; the most breeding
                            species in one habitat
                            </p>
                            <p>Today is committed to a full day game drive safari in Tarangire National Park. Imagine hundreds of zebra stripes
                            reflecting in still waters. Imagine the looming silhouette of elephants burnt into the crimson sunset. Imagine the sight
                            of ghostly baobab trees scattered across shimmering grasslands. These features are not figments of imagination – these
                            features are just a taste of what Tarangire is all about!</p>
                            <p>The most spectacular feature of Tarangire is that it serves as a place of refuge for the largest elephant population in
                            northern Tanzania.Elephant viewing in Tarangire is outstanding and it is likely that you will see hundreds of elephants
                            in a single day. Set against stunning scenery, elephant viewing will undoubtedly prove to be one of the biggest
                            highlights for a safari in Tarangire. Tarangire is an incredible park that will reserve a special place in your heart
                            and memories. Rest assured - no matter what time of year you choose to visit Tarangire, you’ll certainly be glad you
                            did!</p>

                            viewing and photographing. Stretching for 50km along the base of the rusty-gold 600-metre high Rift Valley escarpment,
                            Lake Manyara is a scenic gem, with a setting extolled by Ernest Hemingway as “the loveliest I had seen in Africa”.</p>
                            <p>From the entrance gate, the road winds through an expanse of lush jungle-like groundwater forest where hundred-strong
                            baboon troops lounge nonchalantly along the roadside, blue monkeys scamper nimbly between the ancient mahogany trees,
                            dainty bushbuck tread warily through the shadows, and outsized forest hornbills honk cacophonously in the high canopy.
                            Manyara provides the perfect introduction to Tanzania’s birdlife. More than 400 species have been recorded, and even a
                            first-time visitor to Africa might reasonably expect to observe 100 of these in one day. Highlights include thousands of
                            pink-hued flamingos on their perpetual migration, as well as other large waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants and
                            storks.</p>

                            famous. The best vantage points and worthwhile areas are chosen to give you the best possible chance to observe animals
                            and to capture your perfect photo. Depending upon the time of year, you have the chance to see the great migration with
                            a hundred thousand wildebeests and zebras. During the small rainy season in October and November, you will typically see
                            these herds moving from the Kenyan Masai Mara through the northwest Serengeti to the plains in the south. After the long
                            rainy season in April through June, the herds travel slowly back through the west and northwest Serengeti. With
                            fluctuations in rainfall, this timetable can change the animals’ migration times and routes. Your guide will know where
                            and when to find the animals and makes sure that you can see the animals from the best spots in the national park</p>

                            light of sunrise and predators may still be busy hunting before retiring to rest for the day. Sunrise on the Serengeti

                            on the lookout for lion. Cheetah can also be spotted on the plains in the early morning and late afternoon when
                            temperatures are not too high. They rely on daylight and speed to catch their prey. Hippo pods can be seen in the bigger
                            pools and rivers while crocodiles can be seen sunning themselves on the riverbanks. You will return to Camp in time to

                            Tanzania and Kenya. The most common species found in the "endless plains" are black wildebeest, impala, zebra and
                            buffalo. It also includes jackals, hyenas, hippos, crocodiles, giraffes, elephants, almost all types of antelopes and a
                            rich bird life where birds of prey, big and small, and a various species of vultures are well represented. The Serengeti
                            is probably the most famous game reserve in Tanzania. The park covers 14,763 km square, but the ecosystem is much
                            larger, extending over the Masai Mara, Kenya and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area</p>
                            <p>Today we will drive to Karatu. You will enjoy a last minute game drive in Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro

                            <p>This morning we would leave to spend the day in the native village of Maasai families, discovering their culture. The
                            Maasai are a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. They are among the most
                            well known of African ethnic groups, due to their distinctive customs and dress and residence near the many game parks
                            of East Africa. Visit a Maasai village and get an authentic look at the daily life in this traditional culture! The
                            Maasai are some of Africa’s most iconic people and have maintained the pastoral way of life of their ancestors. In
                            Laiboni, you will see how the people live in harmony with their animals and visit a Maasai home to learn about domestic
                            life. Speak with village inhabitants about their way of life and sample the colorful beaded wares of the Maasai women.
                            This is your chance to get an inside look at this unique culture.
