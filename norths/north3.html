                            <p>Upon your arrival at Kilimanjaro airport, our representative will meet you and drive you to your hotel for a first
                            evening in Tanzania. Arusha is a major international diplomatic hub. The city hosts and is regarded as the de facto
                            capital of the East African Community. Arusha is surrounded by some of Africa's most famous landscapes and national
                            parks. Situated below Mount Meru on the eastern edge of the eastern branch of the Great Rift Valley, it has a mild
                            climate</p>

                            <p>The road transfer from the Kilimanjaro International Airport to your lodge will take about 1 hour, so sit back and enjoy
                            the ride through the city's sub-urban arriving at your lodge for a well deserved overnight.</p>

                            <p>You will be accompanied by a private guide / chief guide who will be responsible for the smooth running of your trip.</p>

                            <p>Early morning you will be picked up from your hotel and drive to Tarangire National Park for a full day of game viewing
                            and photographing. The Park is located about 2 hours from Arusha city. Imagine hundreds of zebra stripes reflecting in
                            still waters. Imagine the looming silhouette of elephants burnt into the crimson sunset. Imagine the sight of ghostly
                            baobab trees scattered across shimmering grasslands. These features are not figments of imagination – these features are
                            just a taste of what Tarangire is all about! The most spectacular feature of Tarangire is that it serves as a place of
                            refuge for the largest elephant population in northern Tanzania.Elephant viewing in Tarangire is outstanding and it is
                            likely that you will see hundreds of elephants in a single day.</p>

                            <p>The morning will be spent sharing in the native village of Maasai families, discovering their culture. The Maasai are a
                            Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. They are among the most well known
                            of African ethnic groups, due to their distinctive customs and dress and residence near the many game parks of East
                            Africa. We will also do a walk to learn more about aboriginal plants. After that you will return to camp for breakfast
                            and then start to walk across peaceful animal corridors in the Great Rift Valley. This will give us the opportunity to
                            see Africa from a slow pace perspective. While walking, our guide will educate you on aboriginal plants and birds. The
                            walking safari is specifically designed to circle back to camp. You will then go back to camp for dinner and overnight.</p>
                            
                            <p>
                            After breakfast, your driver guide will pick you up from the camp and you will drive out to Lake Natron. You drive via
                            Engaruka Town towards Lake Natron on a partly bumpy and dusty road. En route you see many Masai villages, termite
                            mounds, gazelle, giraffe, zebra, baboons, bee boxes, and birds such as vultures, ostrich, starlings, Cory Bustards, and
                            kites. The transfer takes you some 4 hours. After checking in at your campsite and some lunch you go in the afternoon on
                            a guided walk around Lake Natron the lowest point of the Great Rift Valley in Tanzania (600m / 2000 ft) and famous for a
                            vast numbers of flamingos and other water birds due to a high concentrate of in sodium carbonate, algae, and
                            zooplankton. You can go for a hike up the Ngare Sero River which flows in the Lake Natron In contrast to the surrounding
                            dry landscape, here you can find a small paradise.

                            <p>After breakfast you visit Lake Natron to see the flamingos Lake Natron is famous for. If you wish, you can walk at the
                            lake shore in salty water. Lake Natron is one of the most alkaline lakes in the world. Home to millions of tiny
                            crustaceans, the lake is a haven for literally thousands of lesser flamingo's and it is one of the most important
                            flamingo breeding grounds on earth. The area around the lake is dry and desolate. The strangely beautiful landscape is
                            the attraction in this area.</p>

                            <p>After a strenuous walk up the stream, we reach the source of the river, in cascading waterfalls the river gushes out of
                            the mountains. It is an excellent swim in the river and under the waterfalls for a nice cool-down from the hot sun.
                            There may be baboons or other wildlife in the gorge. You will return to camp where your cook would have prepared you
                            dinner. Enjoy your meals under the stars before retiring for the night.</p>

                            <p>Please note that Lake Natron has a very hot weather. It is therefore strongly recommended to bring protective clothing,
                            hat and sunscreen.</p>
