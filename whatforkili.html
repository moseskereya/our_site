                    <h3>Kili-what to know</h3>
                    <p>Climbing to the top of Africa is an incomparable experience. Mount Kilimanjaro was declared a
                        world heritage site by
                        UNESCO in 1989. This mountain is one of the largest volcanoes in the world, which has been idle
                        for centuries. Mount
                        Killimanjaro standing at 5,895m (19.341″”) is the tallest mountain in Africa and the highest
                        free standing summit in the
                        world. The extraordinary fact about this gigantic natural monument is that it has multiple
                        routes therefore allowing
                        everyone to summit, whether they have had mountaineering experience or not.</p>

                    <p>We simply offer the best that nature has to show. Mount Kilimanjaro is Africa’s peak, and is in a
                        unique environment in
                        the world. The weather conditions are very variable, as much from one point to another of the
                        tracks, from dawn to dawn.
                        Despite the fact that it is difficult to predict the weather, our expertise allows us to
                        recommend certain equipment and
                        clothing to maximize your comfort. The temperature above 2,500 m / 8,000 ‘varies between 15 ° C
                        and 25 ° C (60 ° F and
                        80 ° F), while at night the mercury dives below 0 ° C (32 ° F) .</p>

                    <h4>General Recomendations</h4>
                    <h5>Tipping</h5>
                    <p>Tipping is optional, but it is well accepted by the team as an appreciation of the service you
                        have received to your
                        level of quality and satisfaction. It should be given at the end of the trip only.</p>
                    <p>Here’s a suggestion of what the customer usually gives, but this is not a mandatory or limited
                        standard.</p>
                    <p>For the driver-guide, 5-9 USD per person per day.
                        If you also want to give to other people, such as local guides, we suggest $ 2-3 per person per
                        day.
                        Porter in hotels $ 0.50 per luggage and $ 1 to $ 2 in the tip box of the hotel.</p>
                    <p>There is no obligation on your part.</p>
                    <h5>Preparation to Climb Kilimanjaro</h5>
                    <p>The best way to prepare for high mountianeering is to climb high altitudes. Although it’s hard
                        for most people, remember
                        that for high altitude climbs, the longer you take to climb the better it is for your well
                        being. Whether for a hike
                        2,000″” up the local hill or climbing great mountains, just hiking is effective. This will also
                        allow you to get used to
                        your backpack and your hiking boots.</p>
                    <p>Running and cycling are also very good activities to prepare you for mountiaineering and they
                        allow you to be outside so
                        you can test your equipment. Excercising in gyms and training rooms is also good but it is
                        better to exercise in the
                        open air. Do endurance training and not strength training, your endurance is what that will be
                        tested most. An adequate
                        training regimen is to maintain 80% of your maximum heart rate (220 minus your age) for an hour,
                        three to four days a
                        week. Remember that high altitude mountaineering requires acclimatization and a strong mind is
                        as important as the
                        strength of the body. If you are fit enough and choose a climbing route that allows a lot of
                        time to acclimatize, you
                        have the formula for success.</p>
                    <p>Remember, it is not only about the altitude but also your attitude that will help you succeed on
                        your climb.</p>
                    <h5>Respiration during the climbing of Kilimanjaro</h5>
                    <p>When en route to the summit, if you feel breathless, stop and breathe until you feel better. Once
                        your heart rate is
                        back to normal, you can continue. Take regular breaks and take the time to admire the view. If
                        you feel bad, you have
                        headaches, nausea, extreme tiredness or loss of appetite, you may have to go down or stay where
                        you are. In any case,
                        your guide is there to help you and do not hesitate to tell him about your condition.</p>
                    <p>Above all, do not worry about being abandoned on the mountain. Do not be afraid to stop and
                        adjust to your breathing and
                        walking pace instead of wanting to follow others who have a higher endurance. Drink plenty of
                        water throughout the day,
                        between 3L to 5L. Above all, walk at your own pace, this is the key to success for a successful
                        ascent.</p>
                    <p>Our guides, assistants and porters are specially trained to keep an eye on you and react at the
                        first sign of
                        discomfort. Trust them and listen to their advice. If they advise you to stop for a while,
                        listen to them and do not
                        force your physical limit. They are experienced and know exactly how to react to the challenges
                        you might face.</p>
